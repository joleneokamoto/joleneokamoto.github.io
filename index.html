			<h1>jolene okamoto</h1>
			<h3>about me</h3>
			<p>I'm a 4th year computer science major at Northeastern University ('22).
			  I enjoy teaching / mentoring, playing Stardew Valley, cooking, and coding.
				I've worked as a software engineer co-op at
				<a href="https://www.activsurgical.com/" target="_blank">Activ Surgical</a>
				and
				<a href="https://www.hubspot.com/" target="_blank">HubSpot</a>.

				<br /><br />You may have noticed that my site is quite empty.
				I used to be very design-focused when creating my portfolio (old site
				<a href="https://joleneokamoto.github.io/website-v2" target="_blank">here</a>).
				I've since realized I don't love design as much as I love problem solving and building (hence why I work as a back-end engineer).
				<br /><br />This portfolio will be a way to get to know me and my personal goals.
				Obviously, it's a work in progress, but some of my current goals are:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					visit all the national parks
				</li>
				<li>
					make a personal site to store my photo memories
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>

				<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NwYf_mzd6s6PzQoj7iOqmMNnmkPugX5o/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">resume</a>,
